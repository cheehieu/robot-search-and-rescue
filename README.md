robot-search-and-rescue
=======================

A robot designed to efficiently navigate a course and perform search-and-rescue tasks

Developed in fall 2010 for USC's Robotics (CSCI445) course.

Used Lego bricks to build a robot to efficiently navigate a course and perform search-and-rescue tasks. Sensors/actuators included sonar module, IR sensor, resistive contact sensor, compass, web-camera, servo-motors, and gripper. Developed algorithms for object recognition, vision processing, Monte-Carlo localization particle filtering, minimizing sensor error.
